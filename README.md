# Ciranda

**Self-hosted, low-latency screen sharing and voice chat for a group of friends.**
A small Discord you run yourself: voice channels with screen and camera sharing,
text channels, and sub-second latency, because the server only relays video and
never re-encodes it.

Ciranda is a fork of [Harmony by Pedro Lucas Miguel](https://github.com/PedroLucasMiguel/harmony),
and was called Harmony itself up to 4.1.1. Pedro built the project: the server,
the protocol and the original Electron client. Ciranda keeps his server, with a
few small additions that stay compatible, and replaces the client with a native
one written in Rust on [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/), the UI framework behind the
Zed editor.

## What is different in this fork

The client is one native `ciranda.exe`, with no browser engine inside. It talks
to the same server as Pedro's version, and on its first start it moves the
settings folder of Harmony (`%APPDATA%\Harmony`, Electron or native) to
`%APPDATA%\Ciranda`, so an upgrade keeps your servers, your sign-ins, your
private-message keys and your preferences.

The rest is new. A rail on the left keeps every server you joined, one click
apart. Admins and the owner get a server settings page, and what only the owner
may do shows with a lock instead of hiding. Turning the camera on opens a
preview where you pick the camera and the background first. Your profile has its
own page, the app speaks English and Portuguese, and an Update button shows up
when a new release is out. The voice code reconnects cameras and screen shares
by itself after a network blip. Video stays YUV from the decoder to the screen:
the GPU uploads, converts and scales it, and screen shares are encoded by the
graphics card's H.264 encoder through Media Foundation (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel),
falling back to software when there is none.

On the server side, `HARMONY_SIGNALING_URL=auto` hands each client the address it
actually used, so people on the LAN and on a VPN can share one server, and the
owner can give the server a picture. Pedro's browser and Android clients work
against it too: they load uploads with a weekly media key (`/api/media`) and
find the picture under the name they know (`logo`).

## Features

- **Screen or window sharing** at up to native resolution and 120 fps, H.264
  encoded on your GPU when it has an encoder. The sound goes with it: the whole
  computer except the call, or just the shared app.
- **Voice channels** with cameras and screen shares, echo cancellation and
  noise suppression, per-person volume up to 350%, mute, deafen and a
  soundboard anyone in the call can play.
- **Camera backgrounds**: blur, six pictures that ship with the app, or one of
  your own. The person is found on your computer by a small segmentation model;
  only the finished picture is sent.
- **Text channels** with Markdown, attachments, reactions, custom emoji,
  mentions, pins and search.
- **Accounts and roles**: owner, admins and members, with optional
  password-locked channels and one settings page to run the server.
- **Global hotkeys** for mute, deafen and soundboard sounds, working while a
  game has focus.
- **Several servers** on a rail, saved as you join them; right-click one to remove it.
- **English and Portuguese**, following the system or picked in Settings.
- **Runs on almost anything.** The server never decodes a frame, so a
  Raspberry Pi is plenty; upload bandwidth is the only real limit.

## Quick start

**Server** (any 64-bit Linux, x86-64 or arm64):

```bash
sudo server/install.sh
```

or with Docker. See [docker/](docker/).

**Client** (Windows): a native app in Rust and [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/).
With [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and the Visual Studio Build Tools (C++
workload) installed:

```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path client/Cargo.toml   # -> client/target/release/ciranda.exe
```

Or download `ciranda-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Brunovncs/ciranda/releases/latest). It
installs for your user only, with no administrator prompt, and asks whether to
add Ciranda to the Start menu and the desktop. Uninstalling (from Windows'
installed apps) asks whether to keep your settings or remove everything,
`%APPDATA%\Ciranda` included. The same release has
`ciranda-<version>-windows-x64.exe`, the program alone, to keep in any folder
you can write to. When a newer release is out, an Update button
shows at the top of the window. It downloads the new program, checks its
SHA-256, swaps it in and restarts Ciranda, waiting for your voice call to end if
you are in one. Ciranda asks GitHub for the latest release when it opens and
every 6 hours; "Check for updates" in Settings, Advanced, turns that off. A build
made with `cargo run` never replaces itself.
