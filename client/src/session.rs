//! What the window knows about the server it is connected to: who is there, the channels and
//! who is in each, chat history, emoji, soundpad clips, and your private conversations (see
//! `private`). One entity, fed by the realtime socket and by HTTP replies; views observe it.
//!
//! The other servers you are signed in to have a session too, kept in the background for their
//! private messages (see `elsewhere`). Such a session holds no socket while nothing happens: it
//! asks `GET /api/inbox` every so often, opens a socket that hears only what is sent to you when
//! the answer changes or you write, and closes it again once the conversation goes quiet.
