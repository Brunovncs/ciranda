# Third-party material in the client

Everything here ships inside `ciranda.exe`.

| What | Where | Licence |

| Lucide icons, by the Lucide contributors (path data, every icon but `soundboard` and `blur`) | `src/icons.rs` | ISC, below |
| The text field, the theme's Windows accent reader and the widget patterns, from OpenController by Brunovncs | `src/text_field.rs`, `src/theme.rs`, `src/widgets.rs` | MIT |
| libwebrtc, by the WebRTC project, through LiveKit's `libwebrtc` and `webrtc-sys` crates | linked in; `webrtc-sys` vendored in `vendor/webrtc-sys` with a Media Foundation encoder added | BSD 3-Clause (libwebrtc), Apache 2.0 (bindings) |

Ciranda's own icon (`assets/icon.ico` and `assets/icon.png`) is drawn in code by `examples/icon.rs`,
and the camera backgrounds in `assets/backgrounds/` by `examples/backgrounds.rs`. They, and the
`soundboard` and `blur` shapes in `src/icons.rs`, are original to this repository and
covered by its MIT licence.

Rust crates are listed with their licences in `Cargo.lock`; `cargo about` or `cargo license`
produces the full list.
